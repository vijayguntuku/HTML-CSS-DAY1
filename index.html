                    <b>The Charminar</b> constructed in 1591,
                    is a monument located in Hyderabad, Telangana, India.
                    The landmark has become known globally as a symbol of Hyderabad 
                    and is listed among the most recognised structures in India. 
                    It has also been officially incorporated as the Emblem of Telangana.
                    The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), the current caretaker of the structure, mentions in its records, "There are various theories regarding the purpose for which Charminar was constructed. However, it is widely accepted that Charminar was built at the centre of the city, to commemorate the eradication of plague", a deadly disease which was wide spread at that time.[8][9] According to Jean de Thévenot, a French traveller of the 17th century whose narration was complemented with the available Persian texts, the Charminar was constructed in the year 1591 CE, to commemorate the beginning of the second Islamic millennium year (1000 AH). The event was celebrated far and wide in the Islamic world, thus Qutb Shah founded the city of Hyderabad to celebrate the event and commemorate it with the construction of this building.[10][11]: 17–19  Due to its architecture it is also called as Arc de Triomphe of the east.[12]

                    <blockquote>The Charminar was constructed at the intersection of the historical trade route that connects the city to international markets through the port city of Machilipatnam.[13]: 195  </blockquote>The Old City of Hyderabad was designed with Charminar as its centrepiece.[14] The city was spread around the Charminar in four different quadrants and chambers, segregated according to the established settlements. Towards the north of Charminar is the Char Kaman, or four gateways, constructed in the cardinal direction.[10][13][15][16]: 170  Additional eminent architects from Persia were also invited to develop the city plan. The structure itself was intended to serve as a mosque and madrasa. It is of Indo-Islamic architecture style, incorporating Persian architectural elements. A sample of Charminar is said to have been created at Dabirpura/Nagaboli graveyard before the actual construction.
